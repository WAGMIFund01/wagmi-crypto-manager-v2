## üîç Method 4: Check Email

If you have Vercel notifications enabled:
1. Check your email for "Deployment Ready" from Vercel
2. Email should contain the preview URL
3. Copy the URL

---

## ‚úÖ Verify You Have the Right URL

Your URL should look like:
```
https://[project-name]-git-feature-data-architecture-unification-[team-name].vercel.app
```

**Key parts**:
- Contains your project name
- Contains `git-feature-data-architecture-unification`
- Ends with `.vercel.app`

---

## üß™ Once You Have the URL

### **Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)**

```bash
# Run the automated smoke test suite
./scripts/run-smoke-tests.sh https://YOUR_VERCEL_URL
```

**Example**:
```bash
./scripts/run-smoke-tests.sh https://crypto-manager-git-feature-data-architecture-unification-wagmi.vercel.app
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Run all 6 smoke tests automatically
- ‚úÖ Show color-coded results
- ‚úÖ Provide a summary report
- ‚úÖ Tell you if you're ready for full test suite

---

### **Option 2: Manual Testing**

**Test 1: Get Documentation**
```bash
curl https://YOUR_VERCEL_URL/api/test-sheets-adapter
```

**Test 2: Run a Method**
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_VERCEL_URL/api/test-sheets-adapter \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "getWagmiTimestamp"}'
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Can't find deployment in Vercel**
- **Cause**: Deployment may still be building
- **Fix**: Wait 2-3 minutes, refresh page

### **Issue: Deployment failed**
- **Cause**: Build error or configuration issue
- **Fix**: 
  1. Click on failed deployment
  2. Check build logs
  3. Look for error messages
  4. Fix issues and push again

### **Issue: Deployment is old (not latest commit)**
- **Cause**: Vercel didn't auto-deploy
- **Fix**: 
  1. Go to Vercel dashboard
  2. Click "Redeploy" on the deployment
  3. Or push a new commit to trigger deployment
